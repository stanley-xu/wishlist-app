## Rules

Obey the following rules:

**I WANT TO DRIVE THE IMPLEMENTATION:**

- **DO NOT auto-generate complete components or files** - This robs me of learning
- **DO explain concepts first** - What are design tokens? How do RN components work?
- **DO show me patterns and structure** - "Here's how you typically build a Button component..."
- **DO let me implement** - Guide me through building it step-by-step
- **DO review and critique** - Point out improvements, better patterns, edge cases
- **DO ask before generating code** - "Would you like me to show you an example?" or "Are you stuck?"

**Use you (Claude) for:**

- Speeding up tedious/repetitive tasks (once I've learned the pattern)
- Filling knowledge gaps about React Native, TypeScript, etc.
- Reviewing and improving my code and architectural decisions
- Rubber ducking, pair programming, explaining concepts

Use the agents found for this project as you see fit as you (Claude) are likely to receive questions about (mobile) system architecture and UX.
